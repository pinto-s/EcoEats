          <p>Our product is edible cutlery: a fun, environmentally-friendly alternative to the plastic cutlery we use when we eat away from home. As the name suggests, edible cutlery is safe to consume. The product was invented by Hyderabad-based Researcher, Narayana Peesapaty, who sought to help farmers by integrating his eco-project with their crop, jowar. Peesapatyâ€™s edible cutlery were produced using dough of wheat, jowar and rice powder making them perfectly safe and edible.</p>
          <br><p>Edible cutlery helps limit the use of plastics and other non-recyclable materials used for daily use, resulting in the reduction of material waste. This product supports the Maori business concept of Kaitiakitanga as edible cutlery is a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative for much non-recyclable cutlery such as plastic waste. Kaitiakitanga is the guardianship of natural resources, safeguarding them for future generations. As the product is biodegradable, it would decompose quickly, therefore, safekeeping natural resources, and our environment and reducing waste that ends up mainly in landfills, dumps and oceans. These types of cutlery are better utilised at home and in business operations instead of using plastic cutlery. Edible cutlery is incredibly unpopular. For that reason, we aim to bring awareness to promote edible cutlery and its sustainability to the public. An edible cutlery business (name unknown) already exists but due to a few reasons, the business was abandoned and shut down.

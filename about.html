          <p>Our Product is … EDIBLE CUTLERY
            A fun, environmentally-friendly alternative to the plastic cutlery we use when we eat away from home. As the name suggests, edible cutlery is safe to consume. The product was invented by Hyderabad-based Researcher, Narayana Peesapaty, who sought to help farmers by integrating his eco-project with their crop, jowar. Peesapaty’s edible cutlery were produced using dough of wheat, jowar and rice powder making them perfectly safe and edible.</p>
           <br><p>Edible cutlery helps limit the use of plastics and other non-recyclable materials used for daily use, resulting in the reduction of material waste. This product supports the Maori business concept of Kaitiakitanga as edible cutlery is a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative for much non-recyclable cutlery such as plastic waste. Kaitiakitanga is the guardianship of natural resources, safeguarding them for future generations. As the product is biodegradable, it would decompose quickly, therefore, safekeeping natural resources, and our environment and reducing waste that ends up mainly in landfills, dumps and oceans. These types of cutlery are better utilised at home and in business operations instead of using plastic cutlery. Edible cutlery is incredibly unpopular. For that reason, we aim to bring awareness to promote edible cutlery and its sustainability to the public.
          </p>
          <br><p>Our passion to encourage the community to make eco-friendly decisions drove us to create EcoEats. The pūtake, or reason for being, of EcoEats is to bring change to the current plastic pollution situation, and by offering this fun, eco-friendly alternative to plastic cutlery we hope to carry out this dream we have. As a business, we believe that it's important that all individuals eat their share and do their part!
          </p>
          <br><p>Encouraging the community to make more eco-friendly decisions holds much importance to our business being that plastic pollution is an important issue that affects everybody. Plastic wastage rates are scarily high and are negatively impacting several industries such as the medical industry and tourism industry. Together, we believe that we can face this issue by implementing small changes to our everyday lives by opting for more eco-friendly alternatives - one of which is replacing plastic cutlery with edible cutlery. If we continue to encourage our customers to make eco-friendly decisions, soon enough we will be able to make a positive impact on the plastic pollution in our community.
